Hi there! I'm Bradley.

I am a self taught software engineer with a passion for blockchain technology, and finding ways to improve blockchain tech with my talent!

What I'm up to?

- I am in the midst of completing a Solidity Development Bootcamp in order to receive a certification for Solidity development. I anticipate receiving such by the end of March, 2022.
- I am in the midst of completing a full-stack developer bootcamp in order to receive a certification via the following udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/
- I have some projects in the works I cannot wait to share.

I am aiming to be employed full-time in the blockchain industry by the end of 2022.
