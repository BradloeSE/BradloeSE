Hi there! I'm Bradley.

I am a self taught software engineer with a passion for blockchain technology, and finding ways to improve blockchain tech with my talent!

What am I up to?

- I have just completed a Solidity Development Bootcamp and received a certification for Solidity development.
- I am in the midst of completing a full-stack developer bootcamp in order to receive a certification via the following udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/
- I have some projects in the works I cannot wait to share.

I am aiming to be employed full-time in the blockchain industry by the end of 2022.
